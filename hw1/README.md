# cse598-hw1

This Homework Assignment has 2 main parts to it: 
- PINNs Section
- Neural Operators Section

This homework will give you some hands-on practice with these relatively new, state-of-the-art methods. You will not only implement some of them, but you will use them in action in an experimental setup quite common in today's new research (solving relevant differential equations) in science. 

##Setup
### Step 1: Create and enter a virtual environment with python3.9:
`python3.9 -m venv myenv`\
`source myenv/bin/activate`

### Step 2: Clone this repository
`git clone https://github.com/AI-Complexity-Lab/cse598.git`

### Step 3: Go to the HW assignment folder
`cd hw1`

### Step 4: Install requirements with pip
*Make sure pip is installed in your virtual environment.*\
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Step 5: Install Jupyter Notebook with pip
`pip install notebook`

### Step 6: Complete each assignment
Head to the jupyter notebook interface by entering this command:\
`jupyter notebook`\
Next, simply click into the notebook file *'hw1_***.ipynb'* and complete the assignment.
